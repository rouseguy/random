# Visualization and Dashboard for  Data Science using R

>Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space. - Edward Tufte

Learn to think like a data scientist in visualizing the data, create a narrative and publish it on the web as a dashboard

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the workshop, the candidate would’ve learnt about the following:

1. R
2. Basics of Visualization
3. Grammar of Graphics for Visualization
4. Principles of Dashboard Design
5. Static Dashboards
6. Reactive Programming
7. Interactive Dashboards
8. Responsive Dashboards
9. Shiny
10. Deploy the Shiny Dashboard on Cloud

By the end of the workshop, a fully-functional business dashboard will be developed. The attendee will have enough confidence and knowledge to learn further and build dashboards both on the web and on specialized dashboard tools.

### Ideal Attendee

The workshop is open to anyone who’s interested in visualization and dashboard design.

An ideal attendee would be doing some data analysis at work. He/She is comfortable creating charts in Excel. He/She has some programming knowledge (at the minimum: logic, conditions, loop). 


### Workshop Design

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand - Confucius

The workshop will be heavy on hands-on and will be heavy on thinking and critiquing the work as we continue to develop the dashboard. 

**Tools**
We will be using the `R` programming language and `Shiny` framework. 

`Shiny` is based o
