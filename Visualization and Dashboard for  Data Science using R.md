# Visualization and Dashboard for  Data Science using R

>Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space. - Edward Tufte

In this two day workshop, learn to think like a data scientist in visualizing the data, create a story and publish it on the web as a dashboard.

The ever increasing computational capacity has enabled us to acquire, process and analyze larger data-sets and information. However, the human memory and attention required to use this data is more limited and has remained relatively constant. Data visualisation can enable us to compress data and encode them in ways to aid perceptual, cognitive and emotional capacity required to comprehend, retain and make decisions using this data. This workshop is designed to help you learn the art and science of data visualisation and building a data science focussed dashboard.


### Workshop Objectives

The aim of the workshop is to provide a thorough introduction to the art and science of data visualisation and dashboard design.


By the end of the workshop, the candidate would’ve learnt about the following:

1. R
2. Basics of Visualization
3. Understand the value of data visualisation and the role it plays in business analytics and decision making
3. Grammar of Graphics for Visualization
4. Principles of Dashboard Design
5. Static Dashboards
6. Reactive Programming
7. Interactive Dashboards
8. Responsive Dashboards
9. Shiny
10. Deploy the Shiny Dashboard on Cloud

By the end of the workshop, a fully-functional business dashboard will be developed. The attendee will have enough confidence and knowledge to learn further and build dashboards both on the web and on specialized dashboard tools.

### Ideal Attendee

The workshop is open to anyone who’s interested in visualization and dashboard design.

An ideal attendee would be doing some data analysis at work. He/She is comfortable creating charts in Excel. He/She has some programming knowledge (at the minimum: logic, conditions, loop). 


### Workshop Design

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand - Confucius

The workshop will be heavy on hands-on and will be heavy on thinking and critiquing the work as we continue to develop the dashboard. 

**Tools**  

We will be using the `R` programming language and `Shiny` framework.
